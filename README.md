## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kipkemoi-smith/ai-agents.git
cd ai-agents
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from ai_agents import SimpleAgent

# Create a basic agent
agent = SimpleAgent()

# Define agent behavior
agent.add_rule("if temperature > 25, then turn_on_ac")

# Run the agent
agent.start()
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run a specific agent example
python examples/chatbot_agent.py

# Run agent with custom configuration
python examples/trading_agent.py --config config/trading.yaml
```

## 🧠 Agent Types

### 1. Reactive Agents
- **Description**: Simple reflex agents that respond to current perceptions
- **Use Cases**: IoT controllers, basic automation, real-time systems
- **Examples**: Thermostat controller, traffic light system

### 2. Deliberative Agents
- **Description**: Goal-oriented agents that plan and reason about actions
- **Use Cases**: Path planning, resource allocation, strategic games
- **Examples**: Route planning agent, task scheduling system

### 3. Learning Agents
- **Description**: Agents that improve performance through experience
- **Use Cases**: Recommendation systems, adaptive interfaces, optimization
- **Examples**: Reinforcement learning trader, adaptive chatbot

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems
- **Description**: Networks of agents working collaboratively
- **Use Cases**: Distributed systems, swarm intelligence, negotiations
- **Examples**: Distributed computing, auction systems
